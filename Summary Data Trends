# Summart Data Trends

1. Looking at Fig. 3, which explains the number of unique items, average price of unique items, number of purchases of unqiue items, and the total revenue, one can
see that there is nearly 180 unique item purchases, which all average only $3! From these purchases alone, this game generated just a little over $2k in revenue
based of purchasable items.

2. Looking at Fig. 4, which explains the gender demographics, one can see that there is a significant amount of male players compared to females and other / non-disclosed
folks. This may be because it's more socially acceptable for males to play video games compared to females or other / non-disclosed players. This can be seen as a
"sex based purchase" because males are more likely to spend their money on video games while females or other / non-disclosed folks might want to spend their
money on other items (i.e. clothes, jewelry, makeup, etc).

3. Looking at Fig. 6, which explains the total count across age ranges and the percentage of players, one can see that there is a signiciant amount of players
that reside in the age category of 20-24. This may be because most 20-24 year olds have their own jobs by now and can determine how to spend their own money
compared to teens that have "allowances" or need to borrow money from the parents or siblings. The trend slowly dies off while the age category increases and
this can be for multiple reasons (i.e. lack of interest, lack of time, lack of comprehension of new systems, etc.).
